# KatLib
KatLib is library that I personally use to make making plugins for Sponge easier. It contains shaded common libraries and Scala.

## Features
KatLib offers features like:
* Classes to reduce boilerplate in the main plugin file
* Automatically create a plugin command help command
* Help keep order on Configurate stuff
* Shorthand for creating Text objects
